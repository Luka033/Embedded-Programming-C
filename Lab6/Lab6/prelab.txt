1. An interrupt is a hardware or software generated signal when immediate attention is needed by the processor.

The interrupt service routine is a software interrupt handler that is invoked by a hardware device. A request is sent to the CPU which will activate the process. When its complete, the process is resumed from where it was interrupted.

2. Interrupt vector & interrupt handler or internal and external interrupts

3. 
a)Pin change interrupt 1 is enabled and causes an interrupt

b) PCICR is the Pin Change Interrupt Control Register &
   PCMSK0 is Pin CHange Mask Register


c) It determines if the pin change interrupt is enabled for the corresponding I/O pin

4.
PCMSK0 |= (1 << 7);

5. sei() enables interrupts and cli() disables interrupts

6. 
ISR(TIMERn_COMPA_vect) {
	LEDON;
}

ISR(TIMERn_COMPB_vect) {
	LEDOFF;
}
